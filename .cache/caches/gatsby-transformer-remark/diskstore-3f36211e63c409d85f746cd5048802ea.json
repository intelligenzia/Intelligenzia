Have you always wanted to know how the brain works? Do you find consciousness deeply puzzling? Would you like to know more about the philosophy of human mind and artificial intelligence?</p>\n<p>If the answer is yes, you will probably want to consider taking Cognitive Science as a minor in your master’s degree. You can do it!</p>\n<p>The Cognitive Science module (30cr) is available to ALL students of Helsinki university and all exchange students. Students with highly variable backgrounds are encouraged to take the module. (A student with some background in programming, experimental methods, statistics, mathematics, philosophy, psychology or neuroscience may find their background useful on specific courses, but such a background is neither assumed nor required). You can even take individual courses and fit them to your degree according to your personal study plan. The courses are taught mainly in English.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I find the Courses in Weboodi?</strong></p>\n<p>Search for: LDA-C500</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s the up-to-date information on starting courses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>LDA-C5003 Cognitive Modelling Concepts begins next Tuesday 6.9., 12.15, at Metsätalo Lecture room 12 (<a href=\"https://moodle.helsinki.fi/course/view.php?id=25132\">https://moodle.helsinki.fi/course/view.php?id=25132</a>)</li>\n<li>LDA-C5005 Introductory Laboratory Course in Cognitive Science begins next Friday 9.9. 12.15, at Metsatalo Lecture room 4.
