### Intelligenzia is now a cognitive science alumni society

Intelligenzia has officially graduated! Following the rule change that came into effect in September 2021, Intelligenzia ry transformed from a cognitive science student organization into an alumni society. At the same time, the organization resigned from the Student Union of the University of Helsinki. The rule change was prepared from the end of 2020 based on members' wishes.

The decision was driven by alumni's desire for a closer community and the wish to preserve Intelligenzia's important traditions. After the curriculum reform, there haven't been enough new cognitive science students to run their own student organization. However, current cognitive science students are warmly welcome to participate in the alumni society's activities, and Intelligenzia supports students in establishing a new student organization in the future if needed.

All former Intelligenzia members are automatically members of the alumni society if they pay the membership fee by the deadline. More information about membership and joining can be found on the Membership page.
