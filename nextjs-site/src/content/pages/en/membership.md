## Become a Member

As a member, you stay informed about the organization's activities and officially become part of Finland's largest cognitive science society.

### Full Membership

All cognitive science alumni who accept the association's purpose and pay the membership fee can become full members. Cognitive science alumni include everyone who studies or has studied cognitive science. All full members have voting rights and can run for the board.

### Supporting Membership

Others interested in cognitive science can join as supporting members. However, they do not have voting rights at the association's meetings.

### Former Members

If you are already a member of Intelligenzia, you don't need to rejoin, even though the organization was changed from a student organization to an alumni society. You can continue your membership by paying the membership fee by the deadline. You can also upgrade your membership from supporting member to full member at the same time.

### Application Processing

The board processes membership applications at their next meeting. The decision will be communicated via email.
