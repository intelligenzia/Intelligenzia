"What's the difference between cognitive science and psychology?" is one of the most common questions cognitive scientists hear. Short answer: they're close relatives studying the same phenomena from different perspectives and with different emphases.

This page clarifies the differences and similarities.

## Quick Comparison

| | Cognitive Science | Psychology |
|---|------------------|------------|
| **Focus** | Mind and intelligence in general | Human behavior and mind |
| **Scope** | Multidisciplinary (6 fields) | Own discipline |
| **Also studies** | Machine cognition, philosophy | Personality, development, social |
| **Method emphasis** | Computational models | Experimental and clinical methods |
| **Applications** | AI, technology | Therapy, diagnostics |
| **Degrees** | MA/PhD (often multidisciplinary) | MSc/PhD (Psychology) |

## Cognitive Science in Brief

Cognitive science is a multidisciplinary field that emerged in the 1950s to combine six disciplines' perspectives on the study of mind:

1. Psychology
2. Neuroscience
3. Linguistics
4. Philosophy
5. Artificial Intelligence
6. Anthropology

Cognitive science asks: **How does the mind work?** – whether human, animal, or machine mind.

Central to cognitive science is the **computational perspective**: mental processes are described precisely with mathematical models or computer programs. This makes theories testable and connects them to AI research.

## Psychology in Brief

Psychology is the science that studies human behavior and mental processes. It's a broad discipline that divides into many specializations:

- **Cognitive psychology** – Information processing (closest to cognitive science)
- **Developmental psychology** – Human development throughout life
- **Social psychology** – Social interaction and groups
- **Personality psychology** – Individual differences
- **Clinical psychology** – Mental disorders and treatment
- **Neuropsychology** – Brain-behavior relationships

Psychology asks: **Why do people behave and think as they do?**

## Key Differences

### 1. Multidisciplinarity vs. Unified Discipline

**Cognitive science** is a multidisciplinary project. A cognitive scientist may have a background in psychology, philosophy, linguistics, or computer science. This brings breadth but also fragmentation.

**Psychology** is an established, unified discipline with its own institutions, degrees, and professional titles (like psychologist, psychotherapist).

### 2. Computational Models vs. Experimental Tradition

**Cognitive science** emphasizes computational models. A good cognitive science theory can be formulated as a computer program that simulates mental processes.

**Psychology** emphasizes experimental research: controlled experiments, statistical analyses, survey research.

In practice, many researchers do both, but the emphasis differs.

### 3. Machines and Humans vs. Only Humans

**Cognitive science** studies intelligence more broadly: how humans think, but also how animals process information and whether machines could think.

**Psychology** focuses on humans (and to some extent animal models to understand humans).

### 4. Philosophical Questions

**Cognitive science** includes philosophy as part of itself. Questions about consciousness, the mind-brain relationship, and the nature of representation are at cognitive science's core.

**Psychology** is more practical: philosophical questions often stay in the background.

### 5. Applications

**Cognitive science** applies particularly to technology: AI, interface design, learning technologies.

**Psychology** applies to clinical work: therapy, diagnostics, organizational psychology, school psychology.

## Similarities

The differences shouldn't obscure how much these fields have in common:

### Cognitive Psychology

The psychology subfield called **cognitive psychology** studies the same topics as cognitive science: perception, attention, memory, language, thinking. In practice, many researchers identify with both.

### Shared Methods

Both fields use:
- Behavioral experiments (reaction times, accuracy)
- Brain imaging (fMRI, EEG)
- Statistical analyses
- Theory-based research

### Shared Publications

Many scientific journals publish research from both fields:
- *Cognition*
- *Cognitive Psychology*
- *Psychological Review*
- *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*

### Same History

Both fields stem from the 1950s cognitive revolution that challenged behaviorism and began studying the mind scientifically.

## Which to Choose?

If you're considering studies, here are some perspectives:

### Choose cognitive science if...

- You're interested in fundamental questions about mind and brain
- You want a multidisciplinary perspective
- AI and technology interest you
- You like mathematical and computational approaches
- You want to understand what thinking and intelligence generally are

### Choose psychology if...

- You want to work with people (therapist, school psychologist)
- You're interested in human development, personality, or social behavior
- You want a clear professional title and path
- Clinical work or organizational psychology interests you
- You prefer a more applied approach

### You Can Do Both

Many combine psychology and cognitive science studies. For example:
- Psychology bachelor's → cognitive science master's
- Cognitive science studies as a minor alongside psychology major
- Specializing in cognitive psychology

## Practical Differences in Finland

### Studying Psychology

- Entrance exam, limited admission
- Direct path to master's (MSc Psychology)
- Licensed psychologist professional title
- Right to practice as therapist (with additional training)

### Studying Cognitive Science

- Master's program (no direct bachelor's major)
- Multidisciplinary backgrounds accepted
- No special professional title
- More flexible career path

## Summary

Cognitive science and psychology are related fields studying the mind from different perspectives. Cognitive science is broader and more computational, psychology is more established and applied. In practice, they overlap, and many researchers work at the intersection of both fields.

The most important thing isn't choosing the "right" field but finding the perspective that fits your interests and goals.
