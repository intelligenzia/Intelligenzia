## What is Cognitive Science?

Cognitive science is a field that studies information phenomena related to the mind and brain, such as perception, learning, memory, thinking, language, and concepts. What these phenomena have in common is that they can all be considered forms of intelligent information processing.

These traditional research subjects also belong to related fields such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and linguistics. What distinguishes cognitive science is the pursuit of natural scientific and mathematical precision in modeling phenomena. The connection between cognitive science and artificial intelligence and computer science has traditionally been closer than in related fields.

Research is based on empirical natural scientific research methods, such as behavioral experiments and neuroscience methods, as well as computational and mathematical modeling.

### Big Questions

Cognitive science also includes many big questions at the intersection of philosophy of mind, philosophy of psychology, and philosophy of AI:

- How does the picture of the external world formed by the human brain differ from objective physical reality? What is their relationship?
- How are consciousness and mental contents realized in the neurophysiological and computational mechanisms of the brain?
- How has human evolution led to the human brain developing to process information in this particular way?
- Where do the limits of human mind or machine cognition lie? Do completely insurmountable limits even exist?

## History

Cognitive science began as a joint educational program of several disciplines in the late 1980s. It has since developed into an independent discipline through the following stages.

### Timeline

- **1988** The cognitive science program is established. The first cognitive science students (n = 5) begin in the Faculty of Arts.
- **1988** Simpleksi ry, considered a predecessor of Intelligenzia, is founded.
- **1991** The first cognitive science Master's graduate, Patrick May, graduates.
- **1994** Intelligenzia becomes a registered association.
- **1997** The cognitive science professorship is established at the Department of Psychology. It is the first of its kind in Finland.
- **2004** The Faculty of Behavioral Sciences is established; cognitive science moves to the new faculty.
- **2016** Admission of major students is suspended during the curriculum reform.
- **2017** Cognitive science moves back to the Faculty of Arts.
- **2018** Cognitive science moves to the Department of Digital Humanities.
- **2019** The Faculty Council decides to establish a cognitive science Master's study track.
- **2020** Cognitive science can be studied as a major in the LingDig programme.

## "What on Earth is Cognitive Science?" Video Series

In the "Mitä kummaa on kognitiotiede?" (What on Earth is Cognitive Science?) seminar series organized by Intelligenzia, researchers in the field present their work and perspectives on cognitive science. The videos below (in Finnish) provide a comprehensive picture of what cognitive science is in practice.
