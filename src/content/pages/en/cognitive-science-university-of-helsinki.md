---

The University of Helsinki is the home of Finnish cognitive science. Here, the Nordic region's first cognitive science program was established in 1988, and here the field has developed over three decades into its own Finnish version.

Today, cognitive science can be studied as part of the Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities (LingDig) master's program, and several cognitive science-related research groups operate at the university.

## Studying cognitive science

### LingDig master's program

Cognitive science is studied at the University of Helsinki as part of the Faculty of Arts' LingDig master's program (Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities).

The program is two years and includes 120 ECTS credits. The cognitive science study track offers:

- **Theoretical foundations**: Philosophy of mind and brain, cognitive psychology, linguistics
- **Methodological skills**: Experimental methods, statistical analysis, computational modeling
- **Specialization options**: Language cognition, thinking and reasoning, neuroscience

### How to apply?

Applications to the LingDig master's program are made through the university's joint application. Eligibility requires a bachelor's degree. You can apply with various backgrounds—psychology, linguistics, philosophy, computer science, and many other fields provide a good foundation.

Applications are usually in spring, and studies begin in autumn. Check current application periods and instructions on the [University of Helsinki website](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/degree-programmes/linguistic-diversity-and-digital-humanities-masters-programme).

### Course offerings

Courses available to cognitive science students include:

- Introduction to Cognitive Science
- Cognitive Psychology
- Philosophy of Mind and Language
- Experimental Research Methods
- Computational Modeling
- Neurocognition
- Consciousness Studies
- Special topics courses on various subjects

Students can also choose courses from related fields such as psychology, computer science, and philosophy.

## Research at University of Helsinki

### Cognitive Brain Research Unit (CBRU)

CBRU is a research unit affiliated with the University of Helsinki's Faculty of Medicine, specializing in music and speech cognition research.

CBRU research areas include:
- Music processing in the brain
- Speech perception and comprehension
- Music and speech rehabilitation
- Brain plasticity

The unit is particularly known for mismatch negativity (MMN) research and developing music health science.

### Language, Mind and Brain group

This research group focuses on language processing and cognition. Research topics include:
- Sentence processing in the brain
- Bilingualism and multilingualism
- The relationship between language and thought
- Language development

### Other research groups

Several other cognitive science-related research groups operate at the University of Helsinki:
- Theoretical philosophy (consciousness, philosophy of mind)
- Developmental psychology
- Personality psychology and cognitive processes

## History

The history of cognitive science at the University of Helsinki began in 1988:

**1988** – Cognitive science program established in the Faculty of Arts. First five students begin.

**1991** – First cognitive science master's graduate, Patrick May.

**1997** – Cognitive science professorship established at the Department of Psychology—first of its kind in Finland.

**2004** – Faculty of Behavioural Sciences established and cognitive science moves there.

**2016** – Major student admission suspended during curriculum reform.

**2017** – Cognitive science returns to the Faculty of Arts, Department of Digital Humanities.

**2019** – Faculty Council decides to establish a cognitive science study track.

**2020** – Cognitive science can again be studied as a major in the LingDig program.

## Why University of Helsinki?

The University of Helsinki offers a unique environment for studying cognitive science:

**Multidisciplinary tradition** – Cognitive science has always been genuinely multidisciplinary in Helsinki, combining philosophy, psychology, linguistics, and computer science.

**Research quality** – The university's cognitive science research is internationally recognized and respected.

**Networks** – Students become part of an active research community and through the alumni association Intelligenzia, a broader professional network.

**Location** – Helsinki offers a diverse academic environment with multiple universities and research institutions.

## Collaboration with other universities

University of Helsinki cognitive science students and researchers collaborate particularly with:

- **Aalto University** in computational neuroscience and machine learning
- **University of Jyväskylä** in music cognition research
- **University of Turku** in cognitive neuroscience
- International universities through researcher exchanges and joint projects

## Intelligenzia and the student community

[Intelligenzia ry](/) is the association for University of Helsinki cognitive science students and alumni. The association:
- Organizes seminars and events
- Maintains student and alumni networks
- Promotes cognitive science visibility
- Offers mentoring and networking opportunities

Join Intelligenzia during your studies—it's the best way to get to know people and opportunities in the field.
