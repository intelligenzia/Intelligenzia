Cognitive science uses many specialized terms from psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. This glossary explains key concepts clearly.

## Basic Concepts

### Cognition

Cognition refers to the mind's information processing: perceiving, remembering, thinking, learning, language, and decision-making. It's what cognitive science studies.

**Examples of cognitive processes:**
- Recognizing a face in a crowd
- Solving a math problem
- Learning a new word
- Deciding what to order from a menu

### Representation

A representation is an internal model of the external world. The brain doesn't process the world directly but its representations.

**Think of it this way:** When you see an apple, light hits your retina. Your brain constructs a representation—an internal model of the apple that includes its shape, color, and location.

Representations can be:
- **Symbolic** – Language and concepts
- **Analogical** – Mental images, maps
- **Distributed** – Neural network activation patterns

### Information Processing

The view that the mind processes information like a computer: receiving inputs, processing them, and producing outputs. This was the cognitive revolution's core idea.

**Processing stages:**
1. Sensory input (senses)
2. Encoding (converting information to internal format)
3. Processing (operations on representations)
4. Storage (memory)
5. Retrieval (recall from memory)
6. Output (behavior, speech)

### Modularity

The idea that the mind consists of specialized modules that process specific types of information. Jerry Fodor's 1983 theory claims that language, face, and motion perception occur in separate modules.

**Characteristics:**
- Modules operate quickly and automatically
- They are informationally encapsulated (don't know other modules' contents)
- Only input and output formats are compatible with the rest of the mind

### Computational Mind

The theory that the mind is a computational system—it runs algorithms on representations. This makes it possible to model the mind with computer programs.

**Levels:**
- **Computational level:** What task does the system perform?
- **Algorithmic level:** How is the task performed?
- **Implementation level:** In what physical structure is the algorithm realized?

## Perception

### Bottom-up vs. Top-down Processing

**Bottom-up** (data-driven): Processing proceeds from sensory data upward toward more abstract representations. "What the senses tell you."

**Top-down** (concept-driven): Prior knowledge, expectations, and context guide processing. "What you expect to see."

**Example:** You see something in the dark. Bottom-up: Outlines, shadows. Top-down: "I'm in the forest, that could be a bear"—expectation shapes perception.

### Change Blindness

The phenomenon where we don't notice even large changes in our visual field when our attention is elsewhere. Shows that perception isn't a perfect copy of the world.

### Gestalt Principles

Perceptual organization principles described by German psychologists in the early 1900s:
- **Proximity:** Objects near each other group together
- **Similarity:** Similar objects group together
- **Continuity:** We see continuous lines and forms
- **Closure:** We complete missing parts into shapes

## Attention

### Selective Attention

The ability to focus on specific information while ignoring other things. The cocktail party effect: you can follow one conversation in a noisy room.

### Divided Attention

The ability to process multiple tasks simultaneously. Limited: performance decreases as tasks increase.

### Attentional Bottleneck

The limitation of attention: we can't process all information consciously. At some point, processing requires attentional resources, which are limited.

## Memory

### Working Memory

A short-term system that keeps information active and processes it. Capacity is limited (about 4–7 units). Alan Baddeley's model includes:
- **Phonological loop** – Verbal information
- **Visuospatial sketchpad** – Visual and spatial information
- **Central executive** – Coordinates and controls
- **Episodic buffer** – Integrates information

### Long-term Memory

More permanent information storage, practically unlimited capacity:
- **Declarative memory** – Consciously remembered
  - *Episodic*: Personal experiences
  - *Semantic*: General facts and concepts
- **Procedural memory** – Skills and habits (often unconscious)

### Encoding and Retrieval

**Encoding:** Converting information into a storable format
**Retrieval:** Recovering information from memory
**Encoding specificity:** Retrieval works best when the retrieval context matches the encoding context

### Consolidation

The process where memory stabilizes over time. The hippocampus is initially critical, but memories gradually transfer to the cortex. Sleep is important for consolidation.

## Language

### Linguistic Competence vs. Performance

**Competence:** Linguistic knowledge that enables language use
**Performance:** Actual language use, affected by memory, attention, and other constraints

### Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics

**Syntax:** Language structure, word order, grammatical rules
**Semantics:** Meaning, the content of words and sentences
**Pragmatics:** Language use in context, speech acts

### Linguistic Universal

A feature that occurs in all world languages. Chomsky argued that universals reflect innate grammar.

## Thinking and Decision-Making

### Heuristics

Quick, rule-of-thumb reasoning strategies. Often effective but can lead to systematic errors.
- **Availability heuristic:** We estimate probability based on how easily examples come to mind
- **Representativeness heuristic:** We judge how much something resembles a typical example
- **Anchoring:** Estimates are biased by initial values

### Cognitive Bias

Systematic deviation from rational reasoning. Tversky and Kahneman documented dozens of biases affecting decision-making.

### Dual Process Theory

Theory that thinking has two systems:
- **System 1:** Fast, automatic, intuitive
- **System 2:** Slow, effortful, analytical

## Neuroscience

### Neuron

A brain cell that sends and receives signals. The brain contains about 86 billion neurons.

### Synaptic Plasticity

The ability of synapses (connections between neurons) to change with use. "Neurons that fire together, wire together."

### Brain Regions

- **Prefrontal cortex:** Decision-making, planning, impulse control
- **Hippocampus:** Memory formation
- **Amygdala:** Emotion processing
- **Visual cortex:** Visual information processing
- **Broca's area:** Speech production
- **Wernicke's area:** Speech comprehension

## AI and Cognitive Science

### Neural Network

An AI model inspired by brain structure. Consists of layered connected "neurons."

### Deep Learning

Training multi-layered neural networks on large amounts of data. The foundation of current AI.

### Symbolic vs. Subsymbolic

**Symbolic AI:** Uses explicit rules and symbols
**Subsymbolic AI:** Uses distributed representations (neural networks)

## Philosophical Concepts

### Qualia

The subjective quality of experience. What something feels like from the inside. E.g., the redness of red, the painfulness of pain.

### Hard Problem (of Consciousness)

Why does subjective experience exist at all? Why does information processing feel like something?

### Functionalism

The philosophical view that mental states are defined by their functional role—that is, how they relate to inputs, outputs, and other mental states.
