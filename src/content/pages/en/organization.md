## Organization

Intelligenzia ry is an advocacy organization for cognitive science alumni and others interested in cognitive science. Cognitive science alumni include everyone who studies or has studied cognitive science. Intelligenzia aims to promote cognitive science study opportunities and alumni networking, as well as to raise awareness of cognitive science.

The association serves as a link between cognitive science students, alumni, researchers, and the business world, and organizes events and other enjoyable activities for its members.

Intelligenzia (formerly Anti-Kompleksi, Simpleksi) served as the student organization for cognitive science students at the University of Helsinki from 1988 to 2021, when the organization was primarily converted into an alumni society.
