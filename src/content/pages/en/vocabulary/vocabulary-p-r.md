This section contains key cognitive science concepts starting with letters P–R.

## P

### Perception

Sensory representation of environmental stimuli. Perception is an active process where the brain constructs an interpretation from sensory data.

**Perceptual sub-processes:**
- Sensation
- Organization
- Recognition
- Interpretation

### Plasticity

1. "Openness" of individual development programs—genes don't determine complex development minutiae; developmental pattern adapts to individual environment.
2. Central nervous system development through synapse modification and neural network reorganization.

**Types of neuroplasticity:**
- Synaptic plasticity
- Structural plasticity
- Functional plasticity

### Positivism

A philosophical position allowing only hypotheses containing operationalizable or observation-terms-defined concepts. Nothing testable only through observation or observation-based logic lacks scientific meaningfulness.

**Logical positivism:** Vienna Circle (1920s)

### Productivity

A representation system capacity for unlimited complex representation combinations from finite primitive elements.

**Example:** From a finite vocabulary, unlimited sentences can be formed.

### Proposition

A meaningful statement expressing thought content; the basic meaning-bearing unit combining concepts through logical form.

**Properties:**
- Can be true or false
- Language-independent (same proposition in different languages)
- Content of thoughts

### Psychiatry

A medical specialty diagnosing and treating mental disorders.

### Psycholinguistics

A branch of psychology studying language psychological processes and mechanisms.

**Research areas:**
- Language comprehension
- Language production
- Language acquisition
- Reading

### Psychology

Science studying individual behavior and mental processes.

**Major branches:**
- Cognitive psychology
- Developmental psychology
- Social psychology
- Neuropsychology
- Clinical psychology

### Psychometric Research

Psychological measurement research developing tests and scales measuring psychological constructs.

**Examples:**
- Intelligence tests
- Personality tests
- Attitude scales

### Psychopathology

A branch of psychology studying mental disorders and abnormal behavior.

## Q

### Qualia

1. Conscious states' subjective phenomenal contents—qualitative impressions like "redness experience" or "sweetness taste."
2. Direct inner observation objects.

---

## R

### Reasoning

A logical process deriving conclusions from premises.

**Reasoning types:**
- **Deduction:** From general to specific
- **Induction:** From specific to general
- **Abduction:** Inference to the best explanation

### Recursion

A process that calls itself or contains self-references.

**In linguistics:** The ability to embed structures within others indefinitely.
- "The girl who saw the boy who ate the apple that fell from the tree..."

### Reductionism

A philosophical view that complex phenomena can be explained through their simpler components.

**Types:**
- **Ontological reductionism:** Higher-level entities consist of lower-level entities
- **Methodological reductionism:** Research strategy
- **Theoretical reductionism:** Relations between theories

### Reliabilism

An epistemological theory that a belief is knowledge if produced by a reliable process.

### Representation

An internal presentation or model of the external world or abstract objects.

**Representation types:**
- **Symbolic:** Language, concepts, propositions
- **Analogical:** Mental images, maps
- **Distributed:** Neural network activation patterns

**Key properties:**
- Intentionality (directedness toward an object)
- Content (what the representation represents)
- Satisfaction conditions (when the representation is true)
