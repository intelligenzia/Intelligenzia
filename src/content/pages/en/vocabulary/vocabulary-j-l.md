This section contains key cognitive science concepts starting with letters J–L.

## K

### Knowledge

Justified true belief (classical definition).

**Types of knowledge:**
- **Propositional knowledge:** Knowledge that something is true
- **Procedural knowledge:** Knowledge of how to do something
- **Acquaintance knowledge:** Direct experience of an object

## L

### Language

1. Human language capacity and related behavior.
2. Implicit knowledge enabling language speaker competence.
3. A specific natural language (English, Finnish, etc.).
4. Any symbolic system with grammar.
5. A system of signs and meanings.

### Language of Thought

A hypothesis that cognitive activity generally corresponds architecturally to natural language, featuring constituent structures, productivity, compositionality, and systematicity.

**Proposed by:** Jerry Fodor

### Linguistics

Science describing and explaining language function and properties of different languages and their development.

**Subfields:**
- Phonology (sound systems)
- Morphology (word formation)
- Syntax (sentence structure)
- Semantics (meaning)
- Pragmatics (language use)

### Localization

Cognitive function brain localization; complex neural networks distributed across brain regions form anatomically distinct modules.

**History:** Phrenology was an early (erroneous) attempt to localize mental properties based on skull shapes.

### Logic

Philosophy and mathematics studying rational reasoning, reasoning systems, and symbolic notations representing them.

**Types:**
- Propositional logic
- Predicate logic
- Modal logic

### Logical Behaviorism

A metatheoretical position where mental/cognitive term statements can logically translate into purely behavioral statements without meaning change.
