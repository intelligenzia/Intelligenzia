This section contains key cognitive science concepts starting with letters M–O.

## M

### Marr's Levels

David Marr's three-level analysis:

1. **Computational level:** Mathematical information processing—what the system does and why.
2. **Algorithmic level:** Implementation in specific systems—how the task is performed, what representations are used.
3. **Implementation level:** Physical realization—in what structure the algorithm is implemented (e.g., neurons).

### Materialism

An ontological theory that all existing things comprise matter. Often requires causal interaction between material entities.

**Eliminativism:** A radical form of materialism claiming that folk psychological concepts (beliefs, desires) don't correspond to anything real.

### Mechanism

A system analyzable into distinct parts with describable interactions as rule-governed, including non-mechanical biological systems.

### Memory

A cognitive capacity storing information in individual physical structure, retrievable for later cognitive processes through encoding, retention, and retrieval.

**Memory types:**
- **Sensory memory:** Very short-term (ms–s)
- **Working memory:** Short-term, active processing
- **Long-term memory:**
  - Declarative (semantic, episodic)
  - Procedural

### Mental Image

A perception-like mental representation generated from memory rather than sensory stimulus information. Potentially shares phenomenal, cognitive, or neural properties with perception.

**Researchers:**
- Stephen Kosslyn
- Zenon Pylyshyn (critic)

### Mind-Body Problem

The nature of mental/conscious/soul and body/brain/matter relationship.

**Major positions:**
- Dualism
- Materialism
- Functionalism
- Eliminativism
- Emergentism
- Naturalism

### Modularity

1. Psychological functions involve "nature-different" specialized subsystems, not whole-mind capabilities. Often with nativist/localizationist associations.
2. In cognitive neuroscience: functionally and anatomically distinct brain subsystems implementing specific cognitive operations.

**Module properties (Fodor):**
- Domain specificity
- Informational encapsulation
- Speed
- Obligatoriness

### Morphogenesis

Shape and anatomical structure development in individual development.

### Multiple Realizability

"Same" higher-level processes can be implemented in various different lower-level systems lacking commonality except at the higher level.

**Example:** The same software can run on different hardware.

## N

### Nativism

Philosophy/psychology that some knowledge about the world is innate—not observation-based.

**Representatives:**
- Noam Chomsky (language faculty)
- Jerry Fodor (concepts)

### Natural Science

Empirical scientific research pursuing objective knowledge of natural phenomena and governing laws, describing phenomena through general lawfulness and underlying mechanisms.

### Natural Selection

See Evolution (D–F section).

### Neurology

A medical specialty studying nervous system structure, function, and pathological disorders.

### Neuropsychology

A branch of psychology describing mental functioning and brain structure/function relationships. Traditionally focuses on localization questions and local brain damage consequences.

**Research methods:**
- Lesion studies
- Neuroimaging
- TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation)

## O

### Objectivity

Empirical observation foundation requirement; observations are observer-independent when identical methods yield consistent observations regardless of experimenter. Achieved through clearly formulated systematic methods.

### Ontogenesis

See: Individual development.

### Ontology

1. World or domain basic structure, often categorical.
2. Philosophical theories on world basic structure addressing "What exists?", "What constitutes the world?"

### Operationalization

Theory formulation enabling unambiguous testing through defining theory concept application criteria—specifying observation methods for studying described phenomena.

### Learning

A cognitive process where individuals acquire new knowledge from observations. Cognitive changes must maintain logical-rational connections between situation information and acquired knowledge.

**Learning types:**
- Associative learning
- Cognitive learning
- Social learning
- Procedural learning
