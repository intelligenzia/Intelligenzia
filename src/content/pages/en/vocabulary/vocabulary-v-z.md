description: "Cognitive science terms V–Z: valence, validity, bias, virtual reality, visual processing, working memory, and other key cognitive science concepts."

This section contains key cognitive science concepts starting with letters V–Z.

## V

### Valence

The positive or negative dimension of affective experience. Emotions can be described through valence and arousal.

**Examples:**
- Positive valence: joy, satisfaction
- Negative valence: sadness, fear

### Validity

A measure's or test's ability to measure what it's intended to measure.

**Types:**
- **Content validity:** Does the measure cover different aspects of the phenomenon?
- **Construct validity:** Does the measure assess the intended construct?
- **Criterion validity:** Does the measure predict other relevant measures?

### Virtual

Experience or environment produced by computer simulation or modeling.

**Virtual reality (VR):** Immersive technology creating a three-dimensional artificial environment.

### Visual Processing

Processing of visual information in the brain, progressing from the retina to the visual cortex.

**Stages:**
1. Retinal processing
2. Primary visual cortex (V1)
3. Higher visual areas (V2, V4, IT)

**Two pathways:**
- **Ventral pathway ("what"):** Object recognition
- **Dorsal pathway ("where/how"):** Location and action

## W

### Working Memory

A short-term system keeping information active and processing it. Capacity is limited (approx. 4–7 items). Alan Baddeley's model includes:
- **Phonological loop** – Linguistic information
- **Visuospatial sketchpad** – Visual and spatial information
- **Central executive** – Coordinates and controls
- **Episodic buffer** – Integrates information

## X, Y, Z

### Bottom-up vs. Top-down Processing

**Bottom-up** (data-driven): Processing proceeds from sensory data upward toward more abstract representations. "What the senses tell."

**Top-down** (concept-driven): Prior knowledge, expectations, and context guide processing. "What you expect to see."

**Example:** You see something in dim light. Bottom-up: Outlines, shadows. Top-down: "I'm in a forest, that could be a bear"—expectation shapes perception.
