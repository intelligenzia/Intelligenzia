description: "Cognitive science terms G–I: gene, genetics, perception, holism, humanities, hypothesis, implementation, induction, intentionality, and more."

This section contains key cognitive science concepts starting with letters G–I.

## G

### Gene

A DNA system regulating individual development and underlying hereditary mechanisms.

**Key concepts:**
- **Genotype:** An individual's genetic composition
- **Phenotype:** Gene expression as observable traits

### Genetics

A branch of biology describing heredity and genetic inheritance laws and underlying molecular mechanisms.

## H

### Holism

1. Anti-localizationism—the view that psychological functions cannot be localized to single brain regions.
2. A theory that systems cannot be understood by analyzing into independent parts. Systems lack permanent independent essences.

**Opposite:** Reductionism

### Humanities

Disciplines (education, art, religion, anthropology, history, parts of psychology and philosophy) understanding humans and society as meaningful experiences rather than merely natural phenomena.

### Hypothesis

1. An assumption or proposition.
2. A scientific method claim testable through objective systematic observations—a theory prediction.

**Properties of a good hypothesis:**
- Testability
- Falsifiability
- Precision

## I

### Implementation

Higher-level properties' realization in complex lower-level system organization.

**Example:** Software (higher level) is implemented in hardware (lower level).

### Induction

Generalizing reasoning deriving general rules from specific cases as premises.

**Example:**
1. Observed swan 1 is white
2. Observed swan 2 is white
3. Observed swan 3 is white
4. Therefore, all swans are white (inductive conclusion)

**Problem:** Inductive reasoning is not logically binding—the conclusion can be false even if premises are true.

### Intentionality

1. Mental states' "directedness" toward objects (not necessarily existing).
2. Representations' property of having satisfaction conditions.

**Example:** The belief "Santa Claus lives at the North Pole" is directed at Santa Claus, even though Santa doesn't exist.

**Key philosophers:**
- Franz Brentano
- Edmund Husserl

### Introspectionism

An early experimental psychology school using trained observer introspection rather than objective behavior observation.

**Representatives:**
- Wilhelm Wundt
- Edward Titchener

### Self-Correction

Scientific method's capacity for correction through objective, systematic observation methods with testable auxiliary assumptions.
