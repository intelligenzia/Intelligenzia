This section contains key cognitive science concepts starting with letters S–U.

## S

### Semantics

The study of meaning—the meaning of words, sentences, and other linguistic expressions.

**Subfields:**
- Lexical semantics (word meanings)
- Sentence semantics (sentence meaning)
- Formal semantics (logical meaning theory)

### Sensory Memory

A very short-term memory system preserving sensory information briefly (milliseconds to seconds).

**Types:**
- **Iconic memory:** Visual sensory memory
- **Echoic memory:** Auditory sensory memory

### Symbolic System

A system that processes symbols—signs representing something other than themselves.

**Properties:**
- Symbols refer to their objects
- Symbols can be combined according to rules
- The system can manipulate symbols syntactically

### Syntax

Language structure—rules governing word and phrase order and combination.

**Syntax study includes:**
- Word order
- Sentence structure
- Grammatical rules
- Constituent structure

### System

A whole of interacting parts functioning as a unit.

**Systems thinking principles:**
- The whole is more than the sum of its parts
- Relations between parts are critical
- Systems have emergent properties

### Systematicity

Regular connection of cognitive abilities: if you can think "A loves B," you can also think "B loves A."

**Argument for classical cognition:** Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn

## T

### Theory

A systematic explanation of a set of phenomena that produces testable predictions.

**Properties of a good theory:**
- Explanatory power
- Predictive ability
- Simplicity (parsimony)
- Falsifiability

### Thinking

"Higher" cognitive functions excluding language; traditionally divided into problem-solving, reasoning, and decision-making. Distinguished from lower-level processes like perception and attention.

### Thought Experiment

A philosophical and scientific method for evaluating explanations and theories by analyzing their logical consistency and conceptual fit within imagined scenarios.

**Examples:**
- Turing test (AI)
- Mary's room (consciousness)
- Chinese room (understanding)

### Turing Test

A test proposed by Alan Turing (1950) for evaluating machine intelligence: if a human cannot distinguish the machine from a human through text-based conversation, the machine is intelligent.

**Criticism:**
- Chinese room argument (Searle)
- Doesn't test true understanding

## U

### Understanding

A cognitive process where meaning is grasped or constructed.

**Theories of understanding:**
- Propositional understanding
- Narrative understanding
- Embodied/enactive understanding

### Universal Grammar

Noam Chomsky's theory of innate grammatical knowledge common to all humans.

**Arguments:**
- Poverty of the stimulus argument
- Speed of language acquisition
- Common features across languages
