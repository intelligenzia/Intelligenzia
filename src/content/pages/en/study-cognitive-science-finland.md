Cognitive science can be studied at several universities in Finland. This guide explains what options are available, how the application process works, and what the studies include.

## Cognitive Science Master's Program at University of Helsinki

The only Finnish program where cognitive science can be studied as a main subject is the [University of Helsinki's](/en/cognitive-science-university-of-helsinki) **Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities (LingDig)** master's program.

### Program structure

**Scope:** 120 ECTS credits (2 years)
**Degree:** Master of Arts (MA)
**Language of instruction:** Mainly English, some courses in Finnish

### What do you study?

Cognitive science track studies include:

**Theoretical foundations:**
- Introduction to Cognitive Science
- Philosophy of Mind and Language
- Cognitive Psychology
- Cognitive Neuroscience

**Methodology:**
- Experimental Research Methods
- Statistical Analysis Methods
- Computational Modeling
- Programming for Research

**Specialization:**
- Language Cognition
- Consciousness Studies
- Music Cognition
- AI and Cognition

**Master's thesis (30 ECTS):**
Independent research applying learned methods to a cognitive question.

### Application

**Application period:** Typically January–March (check annually)
**Eligibility:** Bachelor's degree or equivalent
**Languages:** Finnish, Swedish, or English

**Suitable backgrounds:**
- Psychology
- Linguistics
- Philosophy
- Computer Science
- Neuroscience
- Mathematics

Applications must include a motivation letter and study plan. Prior experience in the field (courses, research assistant work) is an advantage but not required.

## Cognitive Science-Related Studies Elsewhere

Although the actual cognitive science major is only in Helsinki, cognitively relevant studies can be pursued at other universities:

### Aalto University

[Aalto University](/en/cognitive-science-aalto-university) offers strong opportunities for computational and neuroscientific orientation:

**Life Science Technologies** – Master's program including neuroscience studies
**Computer Science** – Opportunity to specialize in AI and human-computer interaction
**Human-Computer Interaction** – Interface design specialization

Aalto students can also take courses from the University of Helsinki through the JOO agreement.

### University of Jyväskylä

**Psychology** – Strong cognitive psychology and developmental psychology
**Music Science** – Music cognition research and teaching
**HCI (Human-Technology Interaction)** – Cognitive perspective on technology design

### University of Turku

**Psychology** – Developmental and cognitive neuroscience
**Philosophy** – Philosophy of mind and consciousness
**Linguistics** – Language processing

### Tampere University

**Information Technology and Communication** – HCI and game research
**Psychology** – Cognitive psychology

## Bachelor's Degrees and Minors

Cognitive science cannot be studied as a bachelor's-level major in Finland. Instead, you can:

1. **Study your bachelor's in a related field** (psychology, linguistics, philosophy, computer science) and apply to the cognitive science master's program
2. **Choose cognitive minors** during bachelor's studies
3. **Complete JOO studies** at another university

At the University of Helsinki, you can complete a cognitive science minor module (25 ECTS).

## International Opportunities

Alongside or instead of a Finnish degree, you might consider international programs:

**Europe:**
- University of Edinburgh – Informatics: Cognitive Science
- University College London – Cognitive Neuroscience
- University of Amsterdam – Brain and Cognitive Sciences
- Osnabrück University – Cognitive Science

**North America:**
- MIT – Brain and Cognitive Sciences
- Stanford – Symbolic Systems
- University of California San Diego – Cognitive Science
- Carnegie Mellon – Psychology / Machine Learning

**Exchange studies:**
Finnish universities offer exchange programs through which you can complete part of your studies abroad. The Erasmus program covers European universities.

## What Do Cognitive Science Studies Provide?

Cognitive science studies develop skills valued in many fields:

**Analytical thinking** – Ability to break complex problems into parts and approach them systematically

**Multidisciplinary understanding** – Ability to combine perspectives from different disciplines

**Research methods** – Experimental research, statistical analysis, computational modeling

**Technical skills** – Programming, data analysis, brain research methods

**Critical reading** – Evaluating and synthesizing scientific literature

## After Graduation

Cognitive science graduates find diverse employment:

- UX design and user research
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Research and academic careers
- Consulting
- Technology companies
- Education and learning development

## Tips for Applicants

1. **Start early** – Familiarize yourself with the program and its requirements well before the application period
2. **Build relevant background** – Choose courses in psychology, linguistics, philosophy, or programming during your bachelor's
3. **Write a good motivation letter** – Explain why cognitive science interests you specifically and how it relates to your future goals
4. **Network** – Join [Intelligenzia](/en/join) before applying, meet people in the field, and ask about experiences

## Community and Support

[Intelligenzia ry](/) is the community for cognitive science students and alumni. The association organizes:
- Events and seminars
- Mentoring
- Networking opportunities
- Peer study guidance

Join and meet people in the field from the beginning of your studies!
