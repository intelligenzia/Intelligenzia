---

Aalto University represents the more technical and computational side of cognitive science. Although Aalto doesn't have a dedicated cognitive science degree program, the university is one of Finland's and Europe's leading centers for brain research, computational neuroscience, and AI research.

Those interested in cognitive science will find unique opportunities at Aalto to combine technical expertise with the study of mind and brain.

## Research strengths

### Brain imaging

Aalto University houses one of the world's best MEG laboratories (magnetoencephalography). MEG measures the brain's magnetic fields with very high temporal resolution, enabling tracking of brain activity with millisecond precision.

Aalto University's brain imaging infrastructure includes:
- **MEG** – Measurement of brain magnetic fields
- **EEG** – Electroencephalography
- **fMRI** – Functional magnetic resonance imaging (in collaboration with HUS)
- **TMS** – Transcranial magnetic stimulation

This infrastructure enables studying brain function with different methods and combining them.

### Computational neuroscience

Aalto is Finland's leading unit in computational neuroscience. Researchers develop mathematical models describing brain function and use machine learning to analyze brain signals.

Key research topics include:
- Modeling brain function using neural networks
- Brain signal decoding (what a person is thinking or experiencing)
- Brain connectivity analysis
- Modeling the relationship between brain and behavior

### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

Aalto's Department of Computer Science is known for human-computer interaction research. This field studies how people use technology and how technology can be designed considering human cognitive capabilities.

Research topics include:
- Interface design
- User experience (UX)
- Attention and awareness modeling
- Interactive machine learning

### Artificial intelligence and machine learning

Aalto University is home to the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI). FCAI combines AI research with the study of human cognition, aiming to develop AIs that work better with humans.

Cognitively relevant AI research topics:
- Bayesian reasoning and learning
- Human-machine collaboration
- Explainable AI (XAI)
- Cognitive models in AI

## Research units and groups

### Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering

This department combines neuroscience, signal processing, and medical engineering. Research covers:
- Development of brain imaging methods
- Brain signal analysis
- Neurological disease research
- Brain-computer interfaces (BCI)

### Brain and Mind Laboratory

Led by Professor Riitta Hari, this laboratory has studied the brain's social function and developed methods for simultaneous measurement of two people's brains ("hyperscanning").

### BABA Center

A joint research center of Aalto University and the University of Helsinki focusing on infant brain research. Research addresses early brain development and environmental influences.

## Studying at Aalto

Although Aalto doesn't have a dedicated cognitive science degree program, those interested in cognitive science can apply to several programs:

### Life Science Technologies

A master's program combining biology and engineering. Includes neuroscience studies and the opportunity to specialize in brain research.

### Computer, Communication and Information Sciences

Includes human-computer interaction and machine learning studies. Opportunity to specialize in AI and cognitive systems.

### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

Specialization in interface design and user experience, utilizing cognitive understanding of human capabilities and limitations.

## MEG Center

Aalto's MEG center is among the world's leading facilities. The center offers:
- State-of-the-art MEG equipment
- Experienced research team
- Collaboration opportunities with international researchers
- Training in MEG methods

MEG technology is used to study:
- Language processing in the brain
- Music perception
- Social cognition
- Neurological disorders

The Finnish company MEGIN (formerly Elekta Neuromag) is the world leader in MEG devices, and the close connection to industry benefits Aalto's research.

## Collaboration and networks

Aalto collaborates closely with:

**University of Helsinki** in cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience

**HUS** in clinical brain research

**FCAI** in AI research nationally and internationally

**International universities** through researcher exchanges and projects

## Career opportunities through Aalto

Aalto University students and researchers find employment in:

- Technology companies (AI, interfaces)
- Research institutions
- Medical technology companies
- Consulting firms
- Start-up companies

Aalto's entrepreneurship center and start-up culture offer opportunities to found your own companies.
