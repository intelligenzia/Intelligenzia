Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field that combines psychology, computer science, philosophy, neuroscience, and linguistics to study the mechanisms of the mind and cognition. In Finland, you can study cognitive science at two universities: the **University of Helsinki** and the **University of Jyväskylä**.

## What is Cognitive Science?

Cognitive science investigates the workings of the human mind from a multidisciplinary perspective. The field combines:

- **Psychology** – the study of human behavior and mind
- **Computer Science** – artificial intelligence and computational models
- **Neuroscience** – brain structure and function
- **Philosophy** – philosophy of mind and epistemology
- **Linguistics** – language structure and processing

Cognitive science students learn to understand how humans perceive the world, process information, make decisions, and interact with technology.

## University of Helsinki – The Home of Cognitive Science in Finland

The University of Helsinki is the birthplace of cognitive science in Finland. Cognitive science education began in Helsinki in the 1980s, and **Intelligenzia ry** was founded in 1989 as the association for cognitive science students and alumni.

### LingDig Master's Program
