description: Update on cognitive science's situation at the University of Helsinki and the effects of the Big Wheel reform on the discipline's future.
---

The future placement of cognitive science has been open since spring 2015, when the transfer of psychology and logopedics to the Faculty of Medicine began to be prepared. Unfortunately, the situation has still not clarified. Negotiations have been conducted especially toward the Faculty of Science, but no official decision has been made. Decisions are urgent because Big Wheel education reform proposals are already being prepared in every faculty, and cognitive science currently doesn't belong to any of them.

Members of Intelligenzia ry's Board have been actively in contact with department head Jussi Saarinen, administrative director Laura Tuominen, Dean Patrik Scheinin, and Kumpula campus students such as activists from Matlu and TKO-äly. To our knowledge, administrative-level negotiations have been conducted to some extent, but not thoroughly. Department head Jussi Saarinen has invited the Dean of the Faculty of Science, the Vice Dean, and the head of the Department of Computer Science for discussions, but no responses have come. Contact attempts will continue.

Dean Patrik Scheinin has also been in contact with the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Arto Mustajoki, regarding the matter, but according to student activists' information, the contact has been exploratory in nature.

According to Studyinfo, cognitive science has no starting places at the University of Helsinki in 2016. However, no official decision on admission has been made by the Faculty Council.

The Board of Intelligenzia ry has expressed its concern about the future of cognitive science in a statement sent on 27.1. to Vice Rector Keijo Hämäläinen, Big Wheel project group chair Pirjo Hiidenmaa, and secretary Päivi Aros. We received a response from the Rector's Office study affairs director Päivi Pakkanen regarding the position of current students in future changes. The response summarized here:

The transition period for current students will be three years (1.8.2017–21.7.2020), during which current cognitive science students can complete their degrees according to the old degree requirements in the current faculty. Psychology teaching will also take into account the needs of cognitive science students.
New degree programs will become visible when new students are admitted to them. For new teaching, information will be provided on how it applies to studies under the old structure, and correspondence tables will be developed for students. The new service organization will take into account that in fields where changes are greater than in others, sufficient study counseling is needed.
During the transition period, one can transfer to new master's programs after completing the bachelor's degree. It is still open which master's programs will include content suitable for cognitive science.
After the transition period, completing old-format degrees will not be possible. If the master's degree is not completed by 1.8.2020, those with cognitive science degree completion rights will be assigned which master's program the right continues in. This is a master's program that is as close as possible to the old major. The student may be required to complete a reasonable amount of supplementary studies to achieve the new master's program's learning objectives.

Intelligenzia ry will continue to safeguard its members' interests and find answers to students' questions. All students are welcome to discuss the situation of cognitive science on Monday 8.2.2016 at Gustavus Rex from 6 PM in connection with the Intelligenzia ry association spring meeting. Actual discussions will begin after the meeting.

Best regards,

Board of Intelligenzia ry
