After cognitive science transferred to the Faculty of Arts at the turn of the year, the psychology discipline transferred to the Faculty of Medicine. The transfers are at this stage still administrative, meaning students of both disciplines still hang out mostly at Siltavuorenpenger under a common roof. The actual "separation" is ahead at the latest in late summer before the new academic year begins. The relationship between cognitive science's student organization Intelligenzia and psychology's student organization Kompleksi has been warm until now: many joint events have been organized during the cohabitation and students still meet each other constantly in shared courses and outside of them. In the near future, the relationship between student organizations will become a long-distance one physically, but cooperation will surely continue in the future as well.

Last week, our cognitive science hearts were filled with warmth when we noticed a wonderful comic by Arvi Teikari celebrating the shared journey of cognitive scientists and psychology students published in the latest Kompleksi magazine! ❤ Kompleksi: thank you for the shared years, the flattering comic, and congratulations once again in the aftermath of your 70th anniversary celebrations! Intelligenzia will miss the shared times at Siltavuorenpenger. We got permission from Arvi and Kompleksi magazine to publish the comic here on Homunculus as well.
