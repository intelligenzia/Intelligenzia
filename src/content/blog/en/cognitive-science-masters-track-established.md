Intelligenzia can finally joyfully announce that it is possible to apply to study cognitive science again in 2020! The Faculty Council decided this spring to establish a cognitive science specialization track in the new English-language Master's Programme in Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities, which begins in autumn 2020. This has been eagerly awaited, as the intake of cognitive science students has been suspended since 2016 due to university reforms. The discipline moved from the Faculty of Behavioural Sciences to the Faculty of Arts as part of this reform in 2018. Currently, one can only apply to the cognitive science master's program if studying at the University of Helsinki's Faculty of Arts, and teaching is limited.

The application requirements and exact number of students to be admitted are still unclear, but details will be clarified during this year. For now, the idea is that one could get into the master's program directly at least from the languages bachelor's program and probably also from, for example, psychology and computer science bachelor's programs. Intelligenzia's wish is that as many bachelor's programs as possible would be eligible, as this would support cognitive science's interdisciplinarity. There is also no certainty yet whether applicants for the specialization track will be required to have certain academic performance or some kind of entrance exam. Intelligenzia will actively announce application requirements and opportunities as information is confirmed.

University of Helsinki students can already freely take cognitive science courses as minor studies in both bachelor's and master's degrees. More information about courses can be found on cognitive science teaching pages: [https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/Kognitiotiede/Tutkintovaatimukset](https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/Kognitiotiede/Tutkintovaatimukset)
