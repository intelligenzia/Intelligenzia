description: Intelligenzia's new rules open membership to all students interested in cognitive science.
---

Due to the university's degree structure reform, Intelligenzia decided to update its rules in 2017. According to the old rules of the association, only University of Helsinki cognitive science major students could be full voting members. Others interested in cognitive science could join as supporting members.

In December 2017, updated rules came into effect that open Intelligenzia's membership requirements. Going forward, anyone interested in cognitive science who is a member of any Finnish higher education institution's student union and accepts the association's purpose can be accepted as a full member. A full member has voting rights at association meetings and can run for board positions.

Others interested in cognitive science (including non-students) can still apply to become supporting members. A supporting member has the right to attend association meetings and can serve in positions outside the board.
Joining is worthwhile!

As a member, you stay best informed about Intelligenzia's activities and are officially part of Finland's largest cognitive science association. Both membership types are free!
[Apply for membership](/en/join).

The board processes applications at its next meeting and informs about decisions via email. Old supporting members who meet the new rules' requirements for full membership can apply to update their membership using the same form.
