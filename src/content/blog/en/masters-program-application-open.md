Application to the master's program LingDig (Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities) is now open! Cognitive science is one of the program's specialization tracks, meaning it is now possible to apply to study cognitive science at the University of Helsinki for the first time since 2015.

The application is open **03.12.2019-10.01.2020** at [opintopolku.fi](https://opintopolku.fi/app/#!/korkeakoulu/1.2.246.562.17.19284621422).
More information about the program and application process can also be found on [the university's pages](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/admissions/degree-programmes/linguistic-diversity-and-digital-humanities-masters-programme).

Intelligenzia wishes you great success in your application!


### Other Routes
If you already study at the University of Helsinki or another Finnish university, there are currently other paths to cognitive science studies:

### LingDig Master's Program Cognitive Science Track via Option Right
FOR WHOM: Those who completed their bachelor's at the University of Helsinki in the following fields: **languages, philosophy, psychology, computer science, mathematics, biology** or **Bachelor's programme in science**. (note: not social psychology)

HOW: Complete the cognitive science module (KIK-KK100 or LDA-C500) with at least grade 4. When applying for your bachelor's papers, you can use your option right to go to the LingDig master's program Cognitive Science track.

CONTENT: (will be updated with study requirements when published)

NOTE: There are different requirements for other LingDig master's program tracks AND if you get into one, you can change your track later at the end of your studies with a notification. More info about entry criteria for other programs will be available in Studyinfo and from study advisors (hopefully) as well as here when known.

### Changing Master's Program in the Old Requirements System
FOR WHOM: Those studying at the master's level in the Faculty of Arts under old requirements.

HOW: Request to change your master's subject to cognitive science. Cognitive science has special permission to continue old-format studies until 2022.

CONTENT: You study courses according to old requirements, but in practice replace them all with new-format courses. Make a study plan in cooperation with staff by emailing grp-cog-opintoasiat@helsinki.fi.

If you have questions, for example about making a study plan, you can ask our student organization at intelligenzia-hallitus[at]helsinki.fi, university lecturer Otto Lappi (firstname.lastname[at]helsinki.fi), or Metsätalo student services. Answers to general questions can also be found on [our wiki page](https://wiki.helsinki.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=84289414).

### Minor Studies (Modules)
FOR WHOM: All at the University of Helsinki AND others through JOO studies

HOW: Free admission

CONTENT:
- KIK-KK100 Communication and Cognition (in Finnish)
- LDA-C500 Cognitive Science (in English or Finnish)
- KIK-KK100 is slightly more bachelor's level and LDA-C500 slightly more master's level

NOTE: If you are considering cognitive science master's studies, completing minors at a high level ALWAYS helps in all entry paths. Or at least doesn't hurt.

All University of Helsinki students have the right to take cognitive science courses and study modules (formerly minor) at both bachelor's and master's levels. **Although cognitive science can in the future be studied as a major only at the master's level, there are still bachelor's level study modules open to everyone.** Cognitive science can be combined with almost any field and provides depth and perspective to, for example, psychology, computer science, linguistics, phonetics, digital humanities, philosophy, mathematics, biology, or even educational sciences or bioinformatics studies. It provides a broad perspective on the functioning of the mind and various information processing mechanisms and gives excellent tools for interdisciplinary interaction also in working life. The cognitive science teaching pages provide more information [for minor students](https://wiki.helsinki.fi/x/5izoDg).
